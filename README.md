cudaKmeans
==========

A Kmeans Implementation using Cuda to enable GPU usage and acceleration.

Results: Speedups of up to 240 for data sets of one million per two dimensions.

All problem dimensions and data set sizes supported, provided the GPU has enough memory to allocate the data set.

Made for Advanced Computer Architectures class with Artur Gon√ßalves and Daniel Filipe.
